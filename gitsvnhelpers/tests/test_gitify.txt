NOTE: to run this test requires both `svn` and `git` to be on `$PATH`.

Basic Argument handling
=======================

An unknown command raises a SystemExit:


  >>> import os
  >>> from gitsvnhelpers.gitify import gitify
  >>> gitify(args=['xxx', '-v'])
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  SystemExit: 1

A known command doesn't:

  >>> gitify(args=['help'])
  usage: gitify <command> [options] [args]
  ...

Initial execution
=================

Using gitify on a fresh svn checkout which hasn't been cloned before will
initiate cloning of that repository:

  >>> self.checkout('trunk')
  >>> os.chdir(self.checkoutdir)
  >>> gitify(args=['gitify'])
  No git repository found in...
  Initiating cloning into cache.
  Analyzing svn log...
  Cloning file:///...
  Initialized empty Git repository in ...
  ...
  Git branch 'local/trunk' is now following svn branch 'trunk':
  # On branch local/trunk
  nothing to commit (working directory clean)

Subsequent execution
====================

Checking out the trunk to another location and then gitifying that will re-use
the cloned repository:

  >>> trunk_checkout = self.checkoutdir
  >>> self.checkout('trunk', target="foo")
  >>> os.chdir(self.checkoutdir)
  >>> gitify(args=['gitify'])
  Git branch 'local/trunk' is now following svn branch 'trunk':
  # On branch local/trunk
  nothing to commit (working directory clean)

Switching branches between checkouts
====================================

Gitify refuses to work on tags (because working on tags is evil!):

  >>> self.checkout('tags/0.1', target="atag")
  >>> os.chdir(self.checkoutdir)
  >>> gitify(args=['gitify'])
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  SystemExit: 1

But it will work on branches:

  >>> self.checkout('branches/feature-bar', target="bar")
  >>> os.chdir(self.checkoutdir)
  >>> gitify(args=['gitify'])
  Git branch 'local/feature-bar' is now following svn branch 'feature-bar':
  # On branch local/feature-bar
  nothing to commit (working directory clean)

Let's remember where we checked out this branch, so we can revisit it later:

  >>> branch_checkout = self.checkoutdir

Having gitified the branch checkout, if we now re-visit the trunk checkout,
we will find that the git index doesn't match the filesystem anymore:

  >>> os.chdir(trunk_checkout)
  >>> do('git status')
  # On branch local/feature-bar
  # Changed but not updated:
  #   (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  #   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
  #
  # modified:   README.txt
  # deleted:    bar.py
  # modified:   foo.py
  #
  no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

Re-running gitify will take care of this, though:

  >>> gitify(args=['gitify'])
  Git branch 'local/trunk' is now following svn branch 'trunk':
  # On branch local/trunk
  nothing to commit (working directory clean)

Committing changes
==================

Let's change a file:

  >>> do('echo "Updated trunk" >> README.txt')

As expected, git will report the modification:

  >>> do('git status')
  # On branch local/trunk
  # Changed but not updated:
  #   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  #   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
  #
  # modified:   README.txt
  #
  no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

and subversion, too:

  >>> do('svn status')
  M      README.txt

Let's commit the change to git... afterall, that's what the whole point of this
tool is :)

  >>> do('git add README.txt')
  >>> do('git commit -a -m "Updated README" ')
  [local/trunk]: created ...: "Updated README"
   1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)

For svn, the file still appears modified:

  >>> do('svn status')
  M      README.txt

Let's make another git commit before pushing our changes to svn:

  >>> do('echo "# TODO: implement fooberizing" >> foo.py')
  >>> do('git commit -a -m "Added TODO" ')
  [local/trunk]: created ...: "Added TODO"
   1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)

Now we can push our commits to svn using the ``gitify push`` command:

  >>> gitify(args=['push'])
  Committing to file://...testpackage/trunk ...
    M README.txt
  Committed r7
    M README.txt
  r7 = ... (trunk)
  No changes between current HEAD and refs/remotes/trunk
  Resetting to the latest refs/remotes/trunk
  foo.py: locally modified
    M foo.py
  Committed r8
    M foo.py
  r8 = ... (trunk)
  No changes between current HEAD and refs/remotes/trunk
  Resetting to the latest refs/remotes/trunk
  G    foo.py
  G    README.txt
  Updated to revision 8.

Now git and svn are 'in sync' IOW they both agree that there are no uncommitted
local changes:

  >>> do('svn status')
  >>> do('git status')
  # On branch local/trunk
  nothing to commit (working directory clean)
