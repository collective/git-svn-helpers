NOTE: to run this test requires both `svn` and `git` to be on `$PATH`.

Runnign fetch
=============

The fetch updates all or some of the local cashes. It is primarily intended
to be run as a maintenance command, i.e. via crontab to keep local copies 'fresh'.

First we create a checkout. This creates an entry of the testpackage in the cache.

  >>> import os
  >>> from gitsvnhelpers.gitify import gitify
  >>> self.checkout('trunk')
  >>> gitify(args=['gitify'])
  No git repository found in...
  Initiating cloning into cache.
  Analyzing svn log...
  Cloning file:///...
  Initialized empty Git repository in ...
  ...
  Git branch 'local/trunk' is now following svn branch 'trunk':
  # On branch local/trunk
  nothing to commit (working directory clean)

If we run without parameters, it will try to fetch all, in this case, the only one.

  >>> gitify(args=['fetch'])
  fetching .../.gitcache/testpackage
  Done. 1 packages updated.

TODO: test with multiple repos. However, that's just simple globbing, so no
high priority.
