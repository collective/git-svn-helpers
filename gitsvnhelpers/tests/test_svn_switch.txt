NOTE: to run this test requires both `svn` and `git` to be on `$PATH`.

Switching the svn to another branch
===================================

If the svn location changes externally (for example by a change in an
svn:externals or in a buildout source) the gitify init command switches the
git repository to the new branch.

  >>> import os
  >>> from gitsvnhelpers.gitify import gitify

  >>> self.checkout('trunk')
  >>> gitify(args=['init'])
  No git repository found in...
  ...
  Git branch 'local/trunk' is now following svn branch 'trunk':
  # On branch local/trunk
  nothing to commit (working directory clean)

Now we switch the svn from trunk to a branch

  >>> self.shell('svn switch file://%s/branches/feature-bar' % self.repo)
  U    foo.py
  U    README.txt
  A    bar.py
  Updated to revision 6.

Since we did this without 'telling' gitify, the git repo is still on trunk

  >>> self.shell('git branch')
  * local/trunk
    master

Re-running `gitify init` remedies the situation, though:

  >>> gitify(args=['init'])
  Updating existing cache:
  ...

Now, git is on the branch, as well:

  >>> self.shell('git branch')
  * local/feature-bar
    local/trunk
    master
