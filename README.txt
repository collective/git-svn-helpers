git-svn-helpers is a collection of command line tools that greatly simplifies using git for svn repositories. 

Its main goal is to make the process of setting up a local git repository of an existing svn checkout a 'no-brainer'.

It also addresses using a single git-svn repository for working on multiple checkouts of (usually) different branches and switching between them.
